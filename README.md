# OAT
Open-source Advanced Trainer

This is an open-source aircraft design for experimental amateur-built construction. 

It was started as an answer to a problem that a typical grassroots amateur flying club would eventually run into. Their basic trainer, while cheap, safe. and reliable, is also slow, simple, and boring. A typical Bonanza, twin, or anything more complex than an RV-6, is expensive, quirky, and most importantly, very difficult to insure when your members did nothing but fly a Cessna 150 or a CH 750 for a couple hundred hours. Meanwhile, the basic plane needs less and less work, and the "tinkerer" in the club gets no closer to the coveted A&P certificate, nor the experience needed to undertake a Bearhawk or an RV-10. Finally, the club's CFI runs out of skills to teach, as everything advanced requires an expensive rental.

Therefore, what's needed is an advanced trainer to bridge the gap between a simple fixed-gear two-seater and a complex certified aircraft or a twin. 

# So...
